      After an absence of several years, <a href="http://www.luso-sn.com/">Luso</a> is back in a <b>big</b> way.  They are offering <b>giant</b> motorized crank-up towers, like the Luso 28NS of which only a tiny portion is shown here.  This thing is so massive that you had to wonder how they got it into the exhibit hall, and how they got it erected once it was inside.  It makes the standard amateur towers in the next aisle look tiny by comparison.
