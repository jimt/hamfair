The JAIA Ham Fair 2003 was held at Tokyo Big Sight (*sic*)
again this year.  The two day event shrank to only a single
hall.  The club booths (and flea market area) seemed as
active and packed as ever, but the commercial exhibits
were smaller.

The new [Kenwood](http://www.kenwood.co.jp/j/products/radio_index.html)
HF/50 MHz transceiver looks great for operation where space
is limited.  Its detachable front panel and PC control
features look great.  There were also a number of new
antenna releases, from small 2.4GHz mobile antennas to
giant towers.
