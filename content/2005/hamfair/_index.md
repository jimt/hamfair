The Japan Ham Fair 2005 was held at Tokyo Big Sight (*sic*) again this year, August 21 and 22. Attendance was up 2,000 over last year, with 16,000 visiting on Saturday and 13,000 on Sunday.

Yaesu has introduced their new FT-2000 HF to 50MHz transceiver, and Tokyo Hy Power has a variety of new amplifier and automatic antenna tuner products. Icom was showing off the IC-7000 transceiver. Comet and Diamond are each showing new "broadband" short HF antennas.
