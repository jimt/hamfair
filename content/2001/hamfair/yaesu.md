## New FT-897 All Mode Transceiver

* HF-50MHz (100W), 144MHz (50W), 430MHz (20W) base station transceiver
* 200w x 80h x 230d
* Collins mechanical filters, SSB 2.3 kHz, CW 500 Hz
* built-in DSP
* "suitable for outdoor use" (That seems to mean it has a handle on the side. And it runs on 12 VDC. :-)
* big backlit LCD

They were showing "serial number 00001" and gauging reaction. They claim not to have finalized specification, price, or delivery date.

## Club 817

The FT-817 was nicely displayed at the booth, with an emphasis on accessories. Yaesu was showing the SuperAntennas MP-1, Diamond RHM5, and AN-817. A wall display of [Club 817](http://www.standard-comm.co.jp/club817/817top.html) members showed some of their packaging, power, and antenna ideas.
