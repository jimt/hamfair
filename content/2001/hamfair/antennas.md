## Radix Antennas

[Radix](http://www.radix-inc.com/) offer a number of antennas, particularly V-dipoles and small beams. They've designed a new version of their V-dipole that is made for use on the go. Antenna elements screw directly onto the center plate and balun assembly for use on 28 and 50 MHz. Optional base loading coils fit between the element and center plate for use on lower frequencies. It disassembles into parts no longer than 58cm, weighs about 1.2 kg with a pair of coils, and assembles with finger hardware. (RD-S106 Y10,000, coils Y3,000/band)
