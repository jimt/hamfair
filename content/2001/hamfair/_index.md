[Ham Fair 2001](http://www.jarl.or.jp/Japanese/1_Tanoshimo/1-3_Ham-Fair/Ham-Fair.htm) was held in Yokohama, about 45 minutes south of Tokyo
by commuter train.  A ticket to the three day event
cost Y1500 (US$12.60).

The [2002 Ham Fair](/2002/hamfair/index.html) was only
    2 days long, but it returned to Tokyo.
