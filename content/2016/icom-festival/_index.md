Icom took over a floor of the convention hall outside Akihabara Station to showcase
some of their equipment, ranging from the exciting new IC-7300, the "big" HF rigs, and
their family of D-STAR radios. [Flyer](http://www.icom.co.jp/topics/20160120/event.pdf).

The HF corner included a timeline showing the milestones for the company, and the
release of each of the models. They had also brought along a sampling of classic rigs,
which brought a bit of nostalgia.
