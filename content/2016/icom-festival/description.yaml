      Four IC-7300 rigs were set up giving everyone a chance to tune around their 
      favorite portion of 40 meters, and thanks to the RTTY contest, find lots of 
      signals to try the internal RTTY decoder. The 100W version is readily 
      available at Akihabara retailers, with the 50W and 10W versions promised 
      within a couple of weeks. Brochure price: Y139,800 + tax, advertised price: 
      Y128,000 including the 8% tax.

      The IC-7300 presentation included a walkthrough of the features, contrasting 
      the design against the larger Icom rigs, and then comparing some of the 
      receiver specs against the competition

      The D-STAR presentation drew a noticeably larger crowd than the 7300 one. 
      It was essentially a description of the modes available, an update on the 
      repeater infrastructure in Japan, and a reminder of the recently promulgated 
      xxx.30 simplex calling frequencies.
